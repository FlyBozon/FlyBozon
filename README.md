# About Me

Currently pursuing studies in Robotics, Image Processing, and Control Systems with a focus on intelligent algorithms and machine perception. Interested in the development of autonomous systems capable of interpreting their environment - and occasionally questioning their existence.

My work involves practical applications of computer vision, real-time data processing, and control loop design. I’m particularly invested in the intersection of machine learning and robotics, where theory meets slightly unpredictable hardware behavior.

Passionate about **robotic lifeforms**, **image-based sorcery**, and **algorithms that think they’re clever**  

## Tech Arsenal

### Languages (spoken fluently by machines and occasionally by me):
C, C++, Python, C#, Julia, Bash, LaTeX

### Libraries & Frameworks:
OpenCV, ROS, TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, scikit-learn, CUDA, OpenGL

### Data & Infrastructure:
MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Firebase, PlatformIO, Git (source of both power and panic), PowerShell, Google Cloud

### Hardware:
Arduino, ESP32, STM32 and a 3D printer that occasionally sounds like it's trying to escape
