# About Me

- Passionate about **robotic lifeforms**, **image-based sorcery**, and **algorithms that think they’re clever**  
- I make machines that regret their own autonomy  
- Will trade espresso for servo motors, depth cameras, or obscure Qt bugs  
- Specializing in **visual confusion**, **control system dramatics**, and **real-time existential crises**  
- On a lifelong quest to teach computers how to see, and regret what they’ve seen

## Currently Studying:
- Feedback loops that haunt my dreams  
- Vision pipelines that hallucinate in HD  
- Robotics, but emotionally  
- Segfaults in 4D space  
- Deep learning for shallow thoughts  
- Why my ROS nodes have unionized
