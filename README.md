# About Me

Currently pursuing studies in Automatic Control, Cybernetics, and Robotics with a focus on intelligent algorithms and machine perception. Interested in the development of autonomous systems capable of interpreting their environment - and occasionally questioning their existence.

My work involves practical applications of computer vision, real-time data processing, and control loop design. I’m particularly invested in the intersection of machine learning and robotics, where theory meets slightly unpredictable hardware behavior.

Passionate about **robotic lifeforms**, **image-based sorcery**, and **algorithms that think they’re clever**
